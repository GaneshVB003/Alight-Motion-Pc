#  Alight-Motion-PC (Open Source)

>  An open-source desktop motion graphics & video editing tool inspired by Alight Motion ‚Äî made for AMV editors, mobile creators, and low-spec warriors.

---

##  Why?

- Alight Motion is Android-only and closed-source. 
- After Effects is heavy AF and paywalled. 
- Creators like us need a **lightweight, offline, free** desktop tool with AM-style FX. üî•

So we said: *‚Äúfuck it, let‚Äôs build our own.‚Äù*

---

##  Features (Planned)

-  Keyframe timeline (position, scale, rotation, blur)
-  Layer system (video, audio, text, vectors)
-  Effects: Motion blur, Edge Glow, Z-depth transitions
-  Real-time preview (GPU accelerated)
-  Export to MP4 (via ffmpeg or render queue)
-  Import from Alight Motion `.xml` (future goal)
